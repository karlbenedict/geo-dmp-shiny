# geo-dmp-shiny
Shiny application for capturing and displaying mappings between data management and data sharing principles

The ceveloped platform currently runs locally through RStudio's direct support for running R Shiny web appplications and storing source and input data witin the local file system for access and use. Currently community preoposed contributions to the collection of identified principle connections ca be submitted through a GitHub pull request to this repository. Specifically, proposed principle linages are stored in the `submissions` folder in the shared Github repository, and would be included in a proposed pull request to the repository. 

To run the application on your local machine you can download the repository content either through GitHub's clone or download zip file process, start RStudio and open the RStudio project in the downloaded repository folder, and open the `app.R` file from the base directory for the shared respository and click the `Run App` button at the top of the editor window for the `app.R` file. The application will then start up in a web browser window and present and store any existing and added relationships between principles locally. 

For alternative submission methods for proposed additionsl to the collection of linkages please contact Karl Benedict at kbene@unm.edu.
